#Super heros, teams and villians

##Problem
There are too many heros to keep track of, we need a superhero registration
database to track heros, their powers and allies, and their villians.

##User stories
1. each hero
  * will have a name
  * will have a super power
  * can have many villians
  * can be on many superhero teams
2. each villian
  * will have a name
  * will have a super power
  * will have a hero as an arch nemesis
3. each team
  * will have a name
  * will have many heros
